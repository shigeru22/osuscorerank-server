# osu! Inactive Users API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation!

As what have been said in the repository's README, this API is supposed to be used for [Inactive User Rankings](https://github.com/shigeru22/osu-inactive-score) data. However, since osu! API only lists non-inactive data, this may be used for any purposes.

This repository provides REST APIs for retrieving inactive users, along with scores and countries, also with provided token for authentication, insertion or deletion of those data. Before using it, have a look at all of these routes and the usages for each of them, including some prequisites before doing an action.
