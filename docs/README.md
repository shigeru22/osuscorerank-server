# osu! Inactive Users API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation!

As what have been said in the repository's README, this API is supposed to be used for [Score Rankings](https://github.com/shigeru22/osu-inactive-score) data. However, since osu! API only lists global score data, this may be used for any purposes.

This repository provides REST APIs for retrieving user ranked scores, along its respective users and countries. Also with provided token for authentication, insertion or deletion of those data. Additionally, the API also lists inactive users and many more to come later on.

Before using it, have a look at all of these routes and the usages for each of them, including some prequisites before doing an action.
